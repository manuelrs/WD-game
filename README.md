--Game description--
Munchy munchies is two-player, javascript based game. The goal of the game is to collect as many items as possible (burgers, tacos and beers) during the match time.
Player 1 is controlled using the arrow keys of the keyboard. Player 2 uses the WASD keyboard configuration. A compatible language setting is required (not French for example).

--Implementation--
The canvas API was used for the animation of the game. The DOM manipulation was carried out using jquery. The main page uses bootstrap for styling. The characters, floor tiles, tree and town images where downloaded from http://kenney.nl/assets/sokoban. The main character's color was changed to create a second, distinguishable character. The sounds were downloaded from https://www.zapsplat.com/.

--Open topics--
The game needs a phisics library to implement more complex behaviour (e.g. collisions, friction, etc.). Additionally, the gameplay could be improved by adding additional foods/items, adding power-ups/downs to the foods/items, setting up the game in a server, adding background music and nimating the characters among others. Furtermore, additional levels should be developed to make a more engaging game. In an additional step, an algorithm could be developed to generate stages randomly.
